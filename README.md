# Replace Grox

**Replace Grox** is a mod for Spore, which adds a cheat to replace the Grox.
On use, this cheat opens up the Sporepedia and prompts the user to select a creation.
The selected creation is then used as the creature for the Grox empire, instead of the Grox themselves.

The cheat can also be used to revert the Grox back to normal, by using the `-revert` flag.
